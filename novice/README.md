# BMI Calculator
We will build a simple BMI Calculator.

BMI stands for Body Mass Index. It is a calculation based on sex, height and weight. This is chosen since it is quite straightforward but will give us a chance to have a good basic overview of Flutter in not a lot of time. 

Here is what we'll do (colors will be defined by you):

All the assets you need are provided here (the images for the male and female icons) but feel free to use your own.
The calculation is also provided. Feel free to put it into your code as best as you seem fit.
