## Meetup 21.02.2020

Today we will have 2 options: 
* a novice challenge where we will have a simple task that will provide a chance to go through all main points of a basic flutter app

* an advanced challenge where we will (either individually or in groups) try to replicate a Design made by an UI-Professional

So pick your favorite and let's start.
